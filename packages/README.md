  # iost-unofficial - simplyfing the IOST development ecosystem

  ** NOT IMPLEMENTED YET **

  A script that will perform all distro specific functions such as install
  packages, remove packages, etc.  Also distro specific package commands like
  yum or apt.

  This will remove the distro specific complexity in the main bootstrap.sh.
